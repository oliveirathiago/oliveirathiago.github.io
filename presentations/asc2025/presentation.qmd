## My goal today

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

$\leadsto$ Do adolescents with cumulative experiences of police stops develop enduring legal cynicism that persists into adulthood?



## An issue with the literature

Most research on the effects of exposures to policing:

* Treats encounters as isolated moments
  * Police-citizen encounters
  * Police stops
  * Highly publicized incidents
  
* Misses how experiences with law enforcement accumulate over time [@oliveira2021trustworthiness; @oliveira2024aggressive; @oliveira2025legal; @fine2025did]

&nbsp;

$\leadsto$ Yet, encounters are embedded within broader trajectories of repeated experiences and neighbourhood socialisation <i class="fa fa-chart-line"></i> 


# Theoretical foundations

## Procedural justice theory

> "Each of these police-citizen contacts is potentially a 'teachable moment' about policing for both citizens and police" [@tyler2014street, p. 752]

* Every encounter in which an officer exercises authority is a **teachable moment** in which individuals update their expectations about how they will be treated in the future

&nbsp;
  
* *Group engagement model*: fair treatment communicates that individuals are **valued members of the wider group** that legal authority represents <i class="fa fa-building-columns"></i> <i class="fa fa-people-group"></i> [@tyler2003group]


## Legal cynicism theory

> "Legal cynicism refers to a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement, such as the police and courts, are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety" [@kirk2011cultural, p. 1191]

&nbsp;

* Builds on the life-course theory of cumulative disadvantage [@sampson1997life]

* Neighborhood socialization: police officers are there to protect others against us <i class="fa fa-arrows-down-to-people"></i>


# Our proposal

## A developmental model of repeated teachable moments

> <i class="fa fa-signal"></i> Reframe experiences with unjust policing as cumulative, developmental, and contextual

&nbsp;

<div style="margin-top: -10px">  
Each individual event remains a teachable moment, but they are embedded within **trajectories of exposure across the life course**
</div>
<div style="font-size: 0.75em">  
  * <i class="fa fa-car-on"></i> Direct exposures
  * <i class="fa fa-network-wired"></i> Network exposures
  * <i class="fa fa-people-roof"></i> Neighborhood exposures
  * <i class="fa fa-house-chimney"></i> Intergenerational experiences
</div>
  

## Cumulative injustice

Encounters communicate **inclusion** or **exclusion** --- but we need to situate those signals within the temporal, cultural, and structural contexts in which they are lived

&nbsp;

> “I was eight when I first got stopped. (...) Thirteen, fourteen, that’s when I get stopped at least three times a week” [@haldipur2018no, p. 43]

&nbsp;

Accumulated experiences of unjust policing across the life course <br> $\Rightarrow$ socialization context of **cumulative injustice** <i class="fa fa-arrow-trend-up"></i>


# Preliminary empirical evidence

# Data

> British Cohort Study

* Following the lives of 17,000 people born in the UK in 1970
* 12 sweeps of data collection, from infancy to age 46

&nbsp;

**Measures**

* Any experiences of **police stops** between ages 10 and 16
* *Number* of experiences of **police stops followed by a warning** between ages 10 and 16
* **Legal cynicism** measured at ages 16, 26, 30, and 34

## Analytic strategy

> Growth curve model

&nbsp;

* Developmental trajectories of legal cynicism from age 16 through 34
* Influence of the *number* of police stops followed by a warning between ages 10 and 16 on those developmental trajectories
  * Effects on the initial state of the trajectories
  * Effects on the shape of the trajectories

## Analytic strategy

* Binary outcome: Legal cynicism at ages 16, 26, 30, 34
* Time specification: age and age squared (*quadratic growth curve*)
* Main explanatory variable: number of police stops followed by a warning between ages 10 and 16 (square rooted)
* Covariates:
<div style="font-size: 0.75em;">
  * demographics (sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status)
  * psycho-social confounders at age 10 (impulsivity, aggressiveness, learning scores)
  * behavioural confounders at age 10 (bullying behaviour, violent behaviour)
</div>

$\leadsto$ Multilevel growth curve model specified with a logistic function link and interaction terms

## Results

> Average developmental trajectory of legal cynicism among all respondents^[$NT = 28,914; N=10,472; SD(Intercept)=1.526; SD(age)=0.023$]
