## An issue with the literature

Most research on the effects of exposures to policing:

* Treats encounters as isolated moments
  * Police-citizen encounters
  * Police stops
  * Highly publicized incidents
  
* Misses how experiences with law enforcement accumulate over time [@oliveira2021trustworthiness; @oliveira2024aggressive; @oliveira2025legal; @fine2025did]

&nbsp;

$\leadsto$ Yet, encounters are embedded within broader trajectories of repeated experiences and neighbourhood socialisation

## Our goals

<div style="font-size: 0.75em">
> Develop a **developmental model of cumulative injustice**, reframing experiences with policing from isolated encounters to trajectories of exposure across the life course

> Review evidence that *repeated* direct, network, and neighborhood exposures to unfair policing catalyze stigmatized identities and weakened social bonds with the state

> Synthesize **procedural justice** and **legal cynicism** literatures to theorize how exclusionary messages from policing become embedded in identities, communities, and intergenerational narratives

> Specify a research agenda for causal, *longitudinal study of cumulative injustice*, distinguishing exposure timing, dose, and trajectory, and testing identity-based mechanisms of estrangement
</div>


# Theoretical foundations

## Procedural justice theory

> "Each of these police-citizen contacts is potentially a "teachable moment" about policing for both citizens and police" [@tyler2014street, p. 752]

* Every encounter in which an officer exercises authority is a **teachable moment** in which individuals update their expectations about how they will be treated in the future

&nbsp;
  
* *Group engagement model*: fair treatment communicates that individuals are **valued members of the wider group** that legal authority represents [@tyler2003group]


## Legal cynicism theory

> "Legal cynicism refers to a cultural orientation in which the law and the agents of its enforcement, such as the police and courts, are viewed as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety" [@kirk2011cultural, p. 1191]

* A community-level attribute that constrains people's strategies of action

* Builds on the life-course theory of cumulative disadvantage [@sampson1997life]

* Neighborhood socialization: police officers are there to protect others against us


## Some critical views of PJT

&nbsp;

Monica Bell's theory of legal estrangement [@bell2017police]

* Procedural injustice
* Vicarious marginalization
* Structural exclusion

&nbsp;

$\leadsto$ PJT overlooks the broader structural and historical forces that shape how Black communities in the US interpret the law


# Our proposal

## A developmental model of repeated teachable moments

> Reframe experiences with unjust policing as cumulative, developmental, and contextual

&nbsp;

<div style="margin-top: -10px">  
Each individual event remains a teachable moment, but they are embedded within **trajectories of exposure across the life course**
</div>
<div style="font-size: 0.75em">  
  * Direct exposures
  * Network exposures
  * Neighborhood exposures
  * Intergenerational experiences
</div>
  

## Cumulative injustice

Encounters communicate **inclusion** or **exclusion** --- but we need to situate those signals within the temporal, cultural, and structural contexts in which they are lived

&nbsp;

> “I was eight when I first got stopped. (...) Thirteen, fourteen, that’s when I get stopped at least three times a week” [@haldipur2018no, p. 43]

&nbsp;

Accumulated experiences of unjust policing across the life course <br> $\Rightarrow$ socialization context of **cumulative injustice**


## Cumulative injustice

> "At both an interactional and structural level, current [policing] regimes can operate to effectively *banish whole communities* from the body politic. The legal estrangement perspective treats **social inclusion** as the ultimate end of law enforcement" [@bell2017police, p. 2067]

&nbsp;

Cumulative injustice send exclusionary signals

<div style="font-size: 0.75em">  
* The police are not there to protect *us*, the police are there to protect others *from us*
</div>

$\leadsto$ Individuals socialized in a context of cumulative injustice are **labelled as others** and **excluded from the body politic**


## Life-course consequences of cumulative injustice

$\Rightarrow$ **Feelings of non-belonging and social exclusion**


* Erosion of legitimacy & rise of cynicism
 
* Generalized mistrust
<div style="font-size: 0.7em">  
  * Lower civic engagement    
  * Reduced voter turnout  
  * Disengagement from institutions
</div>

* System avoidance

* Crime involvement & resistance

* Stress & intergenerational transmission

## Toward a research program on cumulative injustice

Focus on cumulative exposures to policing during the life course

<div style="font-size: 0.85em">  
* Dose–response
* Timing
* Trajectories
</div>

&nbsp;

**Methodological innovation**

<div style="font-size: 0.85em">  
* **Longitudinal data** linking survey + administrative records  
* **Causal inference**: marginal structural models, LTMLE  
* **Triangulation**: surveys, admin data, ethnography  
</div>

---

## Concluding remarks

* From **isolated encounters** → to **cumulative trajectories**  
* Cumulative injustice reshapes:  
  - Identities  
  - Legitimacy  
  - Civic bonds  
  - Intergenerational narratives  

$\leadsto$ A **life-course science of cumulative injustice**
