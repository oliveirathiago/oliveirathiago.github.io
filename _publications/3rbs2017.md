excerpt: '<i>Social mechanisms of judicial decisions: an explanatory mixed-methods research design on juvenile sentencing</i>. This paper is the result of my MA research on juvenile sentencing in São Paulo. It summarises the result of a mixed-methods research: the first part employs quantitative methods to assess the best (legal and extra-legal) predictors of judicial decision concerning the confinement of young offenders; the second part draws on direct observations at the juvenile courthouse to help explain the mechanisms of the previously estimated coefficients.

*Social mechanisms of judicial decisions: an explanatory mixed-methods research design on juvenile sentencing*. This article discusses the social mechanisms of judicial decisions. The purpose is to explain the decision-making process that culminates in the application of the confinement disposition in the juvenile justice field. The research consisted of an explanatory mixed-methods design. At first, the existing hypotheses were tested with a representative sample of adolescents who went through the courts between 1990 and 2006. Subsequently a juvenile justice courtroom was visited. The results indicate that the standard mechanism of juvenile justice involves decisions taken from police reports, creating a proportionality between the severity of the infraction and the severity of the measure applied; and that there are situations in which the definition of the situation is broken, causing operators to take lenient measures for young, white, non-drug users who study or work.
