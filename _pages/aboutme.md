I am currently a ***PhD candidate in Social Research Methods*** at the [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](http://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology), supervised by [Jon Jackson](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Jonathan-Jackson/Jonathan-Jackson) and [Jouni Kuha](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Dr-Jouni-Kuha). I am also an *Associate Lecturer (Teaching) in Quantitative Research Methods and Data Analysis* at the Department of Political Science, [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science/) until June 2021. Starting this Summer, I'll be a ***postdoctoral researcher*** based at the [Centre for Social Investigation (CSI)](http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk) at [Nuffield College, University of Oxford](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk).

As a quantitative social scientist, I work with topics related to **criminology** and **sociology**. My research interests include the legitimacy of the law and the legal institutions, overpolicing and underpolicing, procedural justice theory, police-citizen encounters, legal cynicism and neighbourhood effects, long-term consequences of exposure to (gun and police) violence, and criminal justice policy. In my doctoral research, I use **longitudinal survey data** to investigate whether police contact is associated with changes in legal attitudes and the extent to which **inappropriate police behaviour** -- including perceptions of police intrusiveness and violence and cynicism about police protection -- shapes attitudes towards legal authority, with particular focus on high-crime contexts. Most of my research relies upon survey data to measure constructs related to legal attitudes and I am particularly interested in panel survey designs to model changes in public opinion.

I am very interested in **social research methods**, especially when it comes to teaching. I am generally keen on teaching topics related to research design, quantitative methods, and statistical software. My main methodological interests in **quantitative social science** include measurement, panel data modelling, causal inference with observational data, spatial data models, and R programming.

From September 2019 to February 2020, I was *Teaching Fellow in Quantitative Research Methods* at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science). Prior to joining LSE, I was a researcher at the [Centre for the Study of Violence](http://english.nevusp.org) of the University of São Paulo (NEV-USP), where I still collaborate as a *Research Fellow*. In 2015, I was a *Visiting Scholar* at the [International Institute for the Sociology of Law](http://iisj.net) in Oñati, Basque Country/Spain. I received both my BA in Social Sciences (2013) and my MA in Sociology (2016) from the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www.fflch.usp.br/).
