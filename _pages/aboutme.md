{% include base_path %}

I am currently based at the University of Oxford, where I work as a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the [Centre for Social Investigation, Nuffield College](http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk) and a **Research Fellow** at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk). I have a PhD from the [Department of Methodology](http://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology), London School of Economics and Political Science. Starting August 2022, I will be a Lecturer in Criminology at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/department-sociology)

As a quantitative social scientist, I work with topics related to **criminology** and **sociology**. I am curious about the consequences of police misconduct and aggressive policing strategies, particularly in terms of people's relationship with the law and the legal institutions. Overall, I use panel survey data and other kinds of data to investigate the extent to which people lose faith in legal authority when they are repeatedly exposed to police brutality and injustice, especially in high-crime contexts, and I am particularly motivated to explore the degree to which this relationship is causal.Topics in which I am particularly interested include the legitimacy of the law and the legal institutions, **overpolicing and underpolicing**, procedural justice theory and legal cynicism, police-citizen encounters and aggressive policing strategies, legal socialisation, exposure to (neighbourhood and police) violence, neighbourhood effects, and criminal justice policy. In some [previous](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/publications_eng/) and [ongoing studies](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/work-in-progress/), I used **longitudinal survey data** to investigate the extent to which police contact was associated with changes in legal attitudes and the degree to which **police misconduct** shaped public attitudes towards legal authority, with particular focus on high-crime contexts such as the city of São Paulo, Brazil. 

Most of my research relies upon survey data to measure constructs related to legal attitudes and I am particularly interested in panel survey designs to model changes in public opinion.

I am very interested in **social research methods**. Most of my research relies upon survey data to measure constructs related to legal attitudes and I am particularly interested in panel survey designs to model changes in public opinion. My main methodological interests in **quantitative social science** include panel data modelling, causal inference with observational data, measurement, multilevel modelling, spatial data models, and R programming. I am generally keen on teaching topics related to research design, quantitative research methods, and statistical software.

I received my PhD in Social Research Methods from the [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](http://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology) in 2021, my MA in Sociology from the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www.fflch.usp.br/) in 2016, and my BA in Social Sciences also from the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www.fflch.usp.br/) in 2013. Prior to joining the University of Oxford in August 2021 and during my PhD years, I was an *Associate Lecturer (Teaching) in Quantitative Research Methods and Data Analysis* at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science) from September 2019 to June 2021. Prior to my doctoral studies, I was a *Research Assistant* and then *Researcher* at the [Centre for the Study of Violence](http://english.nevusp.org) of the University of São Paulo (NEV-USP), where I am still a *Research Affiliate*. In 2015, I was a *Visiting Scholar* at the [International Institute for the Sociology of Law](http://iisj.net) in Oñati, Basque Country/Spain.

I am also a tennis fanatic, a coffee enthusiast, an engaged cyclist, a vegetarian food lover, and am always keen on chatting about those and other topics at anytime. Feel free to drop me a line!
