Welcome to my website! I am currently a *PhD candidate in Social Research Methodology* at the [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](http://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology), supervised by [Jon Jackson](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Jonathan-Jackson/Jonathan-Jackson) and [Jouni Kuha](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Dr-Jouni-Kuha).

As a quantitative social scientist, I work with topics related to **criminology** and **sociology**. My research interests include the legitimacy of the law and the legal institutions, procedural justice theory, police-citizen encounters, legal cynicism, and criminal justice policy. Specifically, I investigate whether police contact is associated with changes in legal attitudes and the extent to which **inappropriate police behaviour** shapes cynicism toward legal institutions, with particular focus on high-crime contexts. Most of my research relies upon **survey data** to measure constructs related to legal attitudes and I am particularly interested in panel survey designs to model changes in public opinion.

I am very interested in **social research methods**, especially when it comes to teaching. I am generally keen on teaching topics related to research design, quantitative methods, and statistical software. My main methodological interests in **quantitative social science** include measurement, panel data modelling, causal inference with observational data, and R programming.

From September 2019 to February 2020, I was *Teaching Fellow in Quantitative Research Methods* at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science). Prior to joining LSE, I was a researcher at the [Centre for the Study of Violence](http://english.nevusp.org) of the University of São Paulo (NEV-USP), where I still collaborate as a *Research Fellow*. In 2015, I was a *Visiting Scholar* at the [International Institute for the Sociology of Law](http://iisj.net) in Oñati, Basque Country/Spain. I received both my BA in Social Sciences (2013) and my MA in Sociology (2016) from the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www.fflch.usp.br/).

On this website, you will find my up-to-date [CV](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/cv/), some research [I am currently working on](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/work-in-progress/), and my [published papers](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/publications_eng/). You can also find a list of papers I published [in Portuguese](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/publications_pt/) -- as a Brazilian, I am very interested in policy-relevant research in Latin America.
