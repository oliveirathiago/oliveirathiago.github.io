I am currently a PhD candidate in Social Research Methodology at the [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](http://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology), supervised by [Jon Jackson](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Jonathan-Jackson/Jonathan-Jackson) and [Jouni Kuha](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Dr-Jouni-Kuha). I am also a Teaching Fellow in Quantitative Research Methods at University College London ([Department of Political Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science)).

My research interests lie in the field of quantitative social science, in particular criminology and sociology, and include public attitudes towards legal authorities, police-citizen encounters, policing, procedural justice, and legal cynicism. Specifically, I am interested in how interactions between power-holders and subordinates might influence various behavioural and attitudinal outcomes. My methodological interests include longitudinal data analysis, latent variable modelling and measurement, survey methods, and causal inference.

Prior to joining LSE, I was a researcher at the [Centre for the Study of Violence of the University of São Paulo](http://english.nevusp.org). I received both my BA in Social Sciences and my master's degree in Sociology from the University of São Paulo.
