Welcome to my website! I am currently based at [Nuffield College in the University of Oxford](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk), where I work as a **Research Fellow** and a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the [Centre for Social Investigation](http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk). I have a PhD from the [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology). Starting August 2022, I will be a Lecturer in Criminology at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/department-sociology).

I am a **criminologist** -- a sociologist at heart and a quantitative social scientist by training, I am curious about the consequences of police misconduct and aggressive policing strategies, particularly in terms of people's relationship with the law and the legal institutions. Overall, I use survey data to investigate the extent to which people lose faith in legal authority when they are repeatedly exposed to police brutality and injustice, especially in high-crime contexts in Latin America, and I am particularly motivated to explore the degree to which this relationship is causal. Topics in which I am particularly interested include the **legitimacy of the law** and the legal institutions, procedural justice theory and legal cynicism theory, **overpolicing and underpolicing**, police violence, legal socialisation, exposure to violence, neighbourhood effects, and criminal justice policy. For my doctoral research supervised by [Jonathan Jackson](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Jonathan-Jackson/Jonathan-Jackson) at LSE, I used longitudinal survey data to study the relationship between perceived police conduct and attitudinal change, with focus on S達o Paulo, one of the largest cities in the Global South. I have good familiarity with quantitative research methods, especially longitudinal data analysis, **causal inference with observational data**, measurement, multilevel modelling, spatial data models, and R programming. My work has appeared in venues such as the [Journal of Quantitative Criminology](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-020-09478-2) and [Law & Society Review](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lasr.12589).

As a Brazilian native, most of my work is focused on big cities in Latin America -- such as the **city of S達o Paulo**. Some of my current projects include assessing the consequences of [police stops at gunpoint](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v58je/), which are surprisingly frequent in S達o Paulo, and the twin harms of [intrusive excess and malign neglect](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/89jkv) which characterise policing in most Brazilian cities. In previous work I assessed the [role of fear and violence](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/lasr.12589) in police-citizen relations in S達o Paulo, as well as discussed the generalisability of **procedural justice theory** in this context (e.g., [here](https://www.scielo.br/j/dados/a/kyK3d9htJj78DZvqF8xGv8K/?lang=pt), [here](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/files/paper_2019rbcs.pdf), and [here](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/files/paper_2016civitas.pdf)).

At the University of Oxford, I am working with [David Kirk](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/david-kirk/) on a project focused on [gun violence in the United States](http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk/?page_id=1573). Drawing on cohort data from the [Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/NACJD/guides/phdcn/index.html), including a new fifth wave being collected in 2021, we are investigating some long-term consequences of **exposure to police brutality** and gun violence during the life course, as well as the reciprocal relationship between police brutality and gun proliferation in Chicago.
