Welcome to my website! I am currently a ***PhD candidate in Social Research Methods*** at the [London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)](http://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology), supervised by [Jon Jackson](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Jonathan-Jackson/Jonathan-Jackson) and [Jouni Kuha](http://www.lse.ac.uk/Statistics/People/Dr-Jouni-Kuha). I am also an *Associate Lecturer (Teaching) in Quantitative Research Methods and Data Analysis* at the Department of Political Science, [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science/) until June 2021. Starting this Summer, I'll be a ***postdoctoral researcher*** based at the [Centre for Social Investigation (CSI)](http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk) at [Nuffield College, University of Oxford](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk).

On this website, you will find my up-to-date [CV](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/cv/), some research [I am currently working on](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/work-in-progress/), and my [published papers](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/publications_eng/). You can also find a list of papers I published [in Portuguese](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/publications_pt/) -- as a Brazilian, I am very interested in policy-relevant research in Latin America.

I am also a tennis fanatic, a coffee enthusiast, an engaged cyclist, a vegetarian food lover. Feel free to contact me!
