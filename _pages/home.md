Welcome to my website! I am currently a ***postdoctoral researcher*** at the [Centre for Social Investigation, Nuffield College](http://csi.nuff.ox.ac.uk) and a ***research fellow*** at [Nuffield College](https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk), University of Oxford. I have just completed my PhD in the [Department of Methodology](http://www.lse.ac.uk/methodology), LSE - London School of Economics and Political Science.

Sociologist by training, criminologist at heart, always a fake statistician, I am a quantitative social scientist interested in studying the consequences of police misconduct and aggressive policing strategies, particularly in terms of people's relationship with the law and the legal authority. I am also a tennis fanatic, a coffee enthusiast, an engaged cyclist, and a vegetarian food lover. On this website, you will find more [about me](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/aboutme) and my research, my up-to-date [CV](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/cv/), some research [I am currently working on](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/work-in-progress/), and a list of my [published papers](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/publications_eng/). You can also find a list of papers I published [in Portuguese](https://www.thiagoroliveira.com/publications_pt/).
