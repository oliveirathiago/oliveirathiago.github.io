<b>Abstract</b>: This paper provides an empirical assessment of predictors and impacts of public judgements about police legitimacy in São Paulo. We tested Tyler's process-based self-regulation model in the Brazilian context drawing on data from a representative survey of adults living in São Paulo in 2015. Our analytic strategy involved structural equation modelling to assess the mediating role of judgements about police legitimacy in a path from trust in procedural justice to public compliance with the law. Results indicate some complexity in the measurement of one's normative duty to obey the police. Based on content analysis of open-ended responses regarding reasons (not) to obey the police, we suggest four groups of respondents: moral duty to obey, disobedient protest, coercive obligation, and authority rejection. Such categories were incorporated in the model. The two former categories, which are composed by respondents who recognise the legitimacy of the authority, are associated with perceived police fairness and predict compliant behaviour, whereas the other two categories do not. Implications for policing policy in Brazil are discussed.

*(Police legitimacy: a measurement model)*

<summary><i>See abstract</i></summary>
<b>Abstract</b>: The purpose of this paper is to develop a measurement model of the sentiments of police legitimacy among São Paulo citizens. National survey-based research on public attitudes towards the legal authorities commonly adopts an operationalist approach, ignoring the gap between concepts and survey questions. We contribute substantively to this research field by developing a measurement model of police legitimacy, which is conceptually defined as a normatively grounded duty to obey the police and a moral alignment with the police. Using data from a representative survey of eight regions of the city of São Paulo in 2017, we performed a second-order confirmatory factor analysis. Subsequentely, we estimated a structural equation model centered on the legitimacy construct so as to validate the measure. Policy implications of both the concept and the measurement of police legitimacy are discussed.

*(Social mechanisms of judicial decisions: an explanatory mixed-methods research design on juvenile sentencing)*

<b>Abstract</b>: This paper discusses the social mechanisms of judicial decisions. The purpose is to explain the decision-making process that culminates in the application of the confinement disposition in the juvenile justice field. The research consisted of an explanatory mixed-methods design. At first, the existing hypotheses were tested with a representative sample of adolescents who went through the courts between 1990 and 2006. Subsequently a juvenile justice courtroom was visited. The results indicate that the standard mechanism of juvenile justice involves decisions taken from police reports, creating a proportionality between the severity of the infraction and the severity of the measure applied; and that there are situations in which the definition of the situation is broken, causing operators to take lenient measures for young, white, non-drug users who study or work.

### [1. Legitimidade da polícia: segurança pública para além da dissuasão](http://oliveirathiago.github.io/files/paper_2016civitas.pdf)

*(Police legitimacy: criminal policy beyond deterrence)*

Published in *Civitas - Revista de Ciências Sociais*, 2016

<summary><i>See abstract</i></summary>
<b>Abstract</b>: Criminal policies in Brazil are premised by the deterrence theory model, which is based on measures such as heavy-handed policing, the growth of social control and surveillance mechanisms, and the increasing number of arrests by police officers. International literature, however, has demonstrated how a police organisation which targets normative instead of instrumental compliance is more effective and less expensive. This paper aims at discussing the theoretical relevance of legitimacy and procedural justice theory for the current debate on police reform in Brazil. It also aims at pointing how the lack of studies concerning the effects of criminal policies implemented in this country have allowed deterrence-based strategies to prosper despite the doubtful results on criminal behaviour control. We indicate how this research agenda might contribute to the discussion on police reform in Brazil and in Latin America.
