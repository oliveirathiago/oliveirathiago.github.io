  <b>Abstract</b>: Policing approaches that rely on repeated intrusion in the lives of citizens can be accompanied by public cynicism about the ability of legal institutions to ensure public safety. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the dynamics of phenomenon of overpolicing and underpolicing over time. It does so in the context of one of the largest cities in the Global South, with a focus on shifts in support for personal use of violence via diminished perceptions of legitimacy. Drawing upon a three-wave longitudinal survey representative of eight neighborhoods in São Paulo, Brazil, I demonstrate that perceptions of overpolicing and underpolicing (a) mutually reproduce each other over time, (b) vary significantly by neighborhood, (c) increase after aggressive police stops, (d) undermine police legitimacy, and (e) contribute to more favorable attitudes towards the acceptability of violence. This study provides further evidence on the costs of coercive policing, with significant implications for people’s recognition of the ruling power of legal authority.

  <b>Abstract</b>: We examine consensual and coercive police-citizen relations in São Paulo, Brazil. According to procedural justice theory, legitimacy operates as part of a virtuous circle, whereby normatively appropriate police behavior encourages people to self-regulate, which then reduces the need for coercive forms of social control. But can consensual and coercive police-citizen policiesbe so easily disentangled in a city in which many people fear crime, where some people fear policebut tolerate extreme police violence, and where the image of the police as “just another (violent) gang ”has significant cultural currency? Legitimacy has two components — the right to power and the authority to govern — and consistent with prior work from the US, UK and Australia, we find that procedural justice is the stronger predictor of the perceived right to power. Yet, the empirical link between legitimacy and legal compliance is complicated by fear of police and different motives to obey and disobey the police. Our modelling of the predictors of self-reported legal compliance finds that criminal behavior is highest among people who fear police, believe that officers act in inappropriate ways, and feel either no obligation to obey their commands or an instrumental obligation to obey the police. Implications of these findings are discussed.

  <b>Abstract</b>. This paper investigates how adolescents are socialised to accept or reject police violence and abuse of power, and how these dispositions influence police legitimacy. Data came from a survey with 724 participants born in 2005, residents of the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Direct and indirect effects of experiences of violence and police contact over adolescents evaluations of police were estimated using structural equation modelling. Results indicate that aggressive and illegal policing, as well as exposure to violence in the neighborhood erode confidence in policing.

  <b>Abstract</b>: Does the experience of being stopped by the police at gun point impact trust in legal authority? Previous research suggests a link between police stops and public attitudes towards legal institutions, but there is little evidence of a causal relationship. I draw on a three-wave survey of adults who reside in São Paulo, Brazil, and explore different methods for causal inference with panel data in the context of two treatment (police stops and police stops at gun point) and three outcome variables (perceptions of police fairness, overpolicing, and cynicism about police protection). I review the assumptions, present results, and discuss the plausibility of four average treatment effect estimators, including two-way fixed effects linear regression, matching for time-series cross-sectional data, a recently developed staggered difference-in-differences design, and front-door difference-in-differences. Results indicate that while it seems unlikely that police stops affect trust in legal authority, aggressive police stops seem to have an impact. It is possible that the experience of being stopped by the police at gun point has a short-term effect on perceived police fairness and a long-term effect on perceived overpolicing.

  <b>Abstract</b>: We study the spatial distribution of stops and searches in London in 2019, and assess the extent to which salient, spatially-granular economic inequality is associated with a higher concentration of searches net of previous crime rates and spatial effects. We interpret stop and search as a tool of social control and demonstrate the degree to which economic inequality contributes to filter out locations where members of the public might stopped and searched by police officers. We use data at the level of Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) and draw on a novel measure of local inequality based on real and estimated housing values. Our analytic strategy involves estimating Spatial Durbin Models to account for spatial dependency and negative binomial regression models to estimate the number of stops and searches by LSOA. Results suggest that local economic inequality is strongly associated with the number of stops and searches, even taking into account spatial effects and previous crime rates. We also find that the effect of inequality depends on the level of affluence: the better off a location is, the stronger the effect of inequality on police stops and searches. We conclude by extending the cultural meaning of stop and search as a tool of social control. Police decisions regarding where to stop and search members of the public could be an additional mechanism that contributes to high levels of ethnic and social disproportionality in stop and search.

  <b>Abstract</b>: To what extent do police officers who are confident of their own authority support (or oppose) police militarization? Previous work has established possible links between police officers’ self-legitimacy and their commitment to democratic policing, which is based on principles of citizen participation, equity and responsiveness. Understood as the process through which policing activities take more and more characteristics of the military culture and behavior, police militarization premises on the idea that police officers should be trained as if they were going to war. Based on this nearly diametrical distinction and given the positive association found between self-legitimacy and commitment to democratic policing, we ask whether self-legitimacy is negatively associated with support for police militarization. Using data from a survey of officers from the São Paulo Military Police in 2016, we assess the extent to which measures of self-legitimacy are correlated with such support controlling for agents’ identification with military values – we also assess the extent to which self-legitimacy mediates the effects or other variables on support for police militarization, such as perceived public support and perceived distributive justice within the organization. Results of structural equation models indicate that while identification with military values mediate some statistical effects of perception of work environment on support for police militarization, self-belief in authority vested in them does not.
