  <b>Abstract</b>: The idea that trustworthiness and legitimacy are ‘hard to win and easy to lose’ — that attitudes are affected more by negative contact than by positive contact — stands as a major challenge to procedural justice theory. In this paper, we revisit the relationship between police-citizen encounters and attitudes towards the police. We analyze data from a two-wave panel study of a nationally representative sample of Australian citizens using autoregressive structural equation modeling. A longitudinal test comparing changes after an encounter indicates slight asymmetry for trust in police effectiveness, strong symmetry for trust in procedural fairness, and strong asymmetry (in the opposite direction expected) for duty to obey the police. In a further investigation, latent moderated structural models find little evidence of heterogeneity in the association between encounters and changes in trust in police procedural fairness and duty to obey, but prior levels of trust in police effectiveness moderate the association between contact and trustworthiness. We conclude with the idea that the association with police-citizen encounters may not be as asymmetrical as previously thought, particularly for changes in trust in procedural fairness and legitimacy. Policy implications include considering public-police interactions as ‘teachable moments’ and potential sources for enhancing police trustworthiness and legitimacy.

  <b>Abstract</b>: In this paper we examine consensual and coercive police-citizen relations in São Paulo, Brazil. According to procedural justice theory, legitimacy operates as part of a virtuous circle, whereby normatively appropriate police behavior encourages public self-regulation and pro-active cooperation, which then reduces the need for coercive forms of social control. Tests of the theory in the US, UK, Australia and elsewhere typically pit normative versus instrumental accounts of crime-control policy against one another. But can consensual and coercive police-citizen power relations be so easily disentangled in a city in which many people fear crime, where some people fear police but tolerate extreme police violence, and where the image of the police as “just another (violent) gang” seems still to have significant cultural currency? Our analysis of the composition, predictors and potential consequences of police legitimacy highlights points of similarity and difference in police-citizen relations in this high violence, high fear city of the Global South.

  <b>Abstract</b>.<br>
  <i>Objectives</i>: Test whether cooperation with the police is a social norm that varies in strength from neighborhood to neighborhood. Test whether police legitimacy plays no role with willingness to cooperate in neighborhoods where the norm is strong but is a positive predictor of cooperation in neighborhoods where the norm is weak.<br>
  <i>Methods</i>: A survey of 1,057 individuals in 98 neighborhoods, defined at small spatial scale, measures (a) willingness to cooperate using a hypothetical vignette and (b) legitimacy using normative alignment indicators. A mixed-effects location-scale model estimates the cluster-level mean and variance of cooperation as a latent variable. A cross-level interaction tests whether legitimacy predicts cooperation only in neighborhoods where the norm to cooperate is weak.<br>
  <i>Results</i>: Willingness to cooperate with the police clusters strongly by neighborhood and there are neighborhoods with (i) high mean and low variance, (ii) high mean and high variance, (iii) (relatively) low mean and low variance, and (iv) (relatively) low mean and high variance. Legitimacy is only a positive predictor of cooperation in neighborhoods that have a low mean and high variance. In neighborhoods where the norm to cooperate is strong, most people are willing to engage so there is little variance left over to explain.<br>
  <i>Conclusions</i>: Findings support a boundary condition of procedural justice theory: namely, cooperation with the police is a social norm that varies from neighborhood to neighborhood and that legitimacy only plays a role in neighborhoods where the social norm is weak.

  <b>Abstract</b>. This paper investigates how adolescents are socialised to accept or reject police violence and abuse of power, and how these dispositions influence police legitimacy. Data came from a survey with 724 participants born in 2005, residents of the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Direct and indirect effects of experiences of violence and police contact over adolescents evaluations of police were estimated using structural equation modelling. Results indicate that aggressive and illegal policing, as well as exposure to violence in the neighborhood erode confidence in policing.

- **Mind the gap between law and enforcement: cynicism toward legal institutions in São Paulo neighborhoods**

  <b>Abstract</b>: People judge the legitimacy of legal institutions in relation to their judgements about the legitimacy of the law. Cynicism toward legal institutions refers to the gap between the two, when people expect the law to be enforced but do not believe the police have the right to enforce it. In this study, I analyze this novel conception of cynicism toward legal institutions in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, a high-crime context where violent interactions with armed military police officers are common in some neighborhoods but nonexistent in others. Drawing on three waves of data from a representative survey of adult residents of eight neighborhoods, I study the correlates, a potential cause, and the consequences of having cynic views about the police. Mixed-effects models assess the association with common correlates of legal attitudes such as neighborhood structural conditions and police trustworthiness, traditional and weighted two-way fixed effects models assess the impact of being stopped by the police at gun point, and a cross-lagged panel model assesses the reciprocal relationship between cynicism and attitudes towards the acceptability of use of violence. Results indicate that common correlates of legal attitudes are also associated with cynicism, that overpolicing feeds cynicism toward legal institutions, and that when the gap between views on the content and the agents of the law widens, conditions are created for the public to turn to alternative strategies of law enforcement. This study provides further evidence on the costs of aggressive policing, with implications to people's recognition of the ruling power of the law and the legal institutions.

  <b>Abstract</b>: To what extent do police officers who are confident of their own authority support (or oppose) police militarization? Previous work has established possible links between police officers’ self-legitimacy and their commitment to democratic policing, which is based on principles of citizen participation, equity and responsiveness. Understood as the process through which policing activities take more and more characteristics of the military culture and behavior, police militarization premises on the idea that police officers should be trained as if they were going to war. Based on this nearly diametrical distinction and given the positive association found between self-legitimacy and commitment to democratic policing, we ask whether self-legitimacy is negatively associated with support for police militarization. Using data from a survey of officers from the São Paulo Military Police in 2016, we assess the extent to which measures of self-legitimacy are correlated with such support controlling for agents’ identification with military values – we also assess the extent to which self-legitimacy mediates the effects or other variables on support for police militarization, such as perceived public support and perceived distributive justice within the organization. Results of structural equation models indicate that while identification with military values mediate some statistical effects of perception of work environment on support for police militarization, self-belief in authority vested in them does not.

- **Salient inequality and the spatial distribution of stop and searches: evidence from London**

  <b>Abstract</b>: We study the relationship between salient, spatially-granular economic inequality and police stop and search behaviour in London. Our measure of local inequality is novel, based on real and estimated housing values. Combining this measure with granular stop and search data, we find LSOA-level inequality is strongly associated with the number of police stops, controlling for neighbourhood crime deprivation and other important contextual variables. We argue that, since police stops are discretionary, the effect of inequality is likely operating through a heightened sense of potential threat that is bred by the salience of inequality itself. Moreover, we find the interaction between local average wealth and inequality to be significant, suggesting that the effect of inequality on police stops depends on the level of average wealth: the wealthier an area is, the stronger the effect of inequality on police stops and searches. We perform a number of robustness checks, including in other metropolitan areas (Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool), and find the results to hold.
