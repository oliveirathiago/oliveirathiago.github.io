  This article advances an analytical model of legal cynicism by examining the enduring legacy of abusive policing practices within neighborhoods across decades. We assess the extent to which the over-policing of neighborhoods fosters cynicism of legal norms and institutions, which in turn contributes to the persistence of violence. We also specify theoretical macro-micro mechanisms and suggest that legal cynicism can operate both as a place-oriented, cultural frame and a person-oriented, cognitive frame. By linking data on civilian complaints about police use-of-force and abuse filed against Chicago Police Department officers from 1991 to 2016 with community and longitudinal survey data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, as well as police-recorded crimes and the US Census, we test different mechanisms through which over-policing shapes violence. First, at the neighborhood level, we show that concentrations of complaints about over-policing are associated with subsequent increases in violent crime, and that a neighborhood culture of cynicism about police capacity and intentions mediates these effects. Second, at the individual level, we show that cumulative neighborhood exposure to over-policing is associated with criminal offending, and that adolescents growing up in over-policed neighborhoods develop persistent cynicism about collective moral rules, lasting into adulthood up to twenty years later. We therefore advance a theoretical framework using novel data and advanced statistical methods to provide key insights into the enduring legacy of abusive policing for legal cynicism and the reproduction of violence.
