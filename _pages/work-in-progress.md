  <b>Abstract</b>: In this paper we examine consensual and coercive police-citizen relations in São Paulo, Brazil. According to procedural justice theory, legitimacy operates as part of a virtuous circle, whereby normatively appropriate police behavior encourages public self-regulation and pro-active cooperation, which then reduces the need for coercive forms of social control. Tests of the theory in the US, UK, Australia and elsewhere typically pit normative versus instrumental accounts of crime-control policy against one another. But can consensual and coercive police-citizen power relations be so easily disentangled in a city in which many people fear crime, where some people fear police but tolerate extreme police violence, and where the image of the police as “just another (violent) gang” seems still to have significant cultural currency? Our analysis of the composition, predictors and potential consequences of police legitimacy highlights points of similarity and difference in police-citizen relations in this high violence, high fear city of the Global South.

  <b>Abstract</b>. This paper investigates how adolescents are socialised to accept or reject police violence and abuse of power, and how these dispositions influence police legitimacy. Data came from a survey with 724 participants born in 2005, residents of the city of São Paulo, Brazil. Direct and indirect effects of experiences of violence and police contact over adolescents evaluations of police were estimated using structural equation modelling. Results indicate that aggressive and illegal policing, as well as exposure to violence in the neighborhood erode confidence in policing.

  <b>Abstract</b>: Residents of over-policed neighborhoods often report feeling under-policed, a phenomenon the literature has named the ‘overpolicing-underpolicing’ paradox -- feelings of constant police intrusion and yet lack of police protection. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the long-term dynamics of perceived overpolicing and underpolicing over time, and it does so in the context of Sao Paulo, Brazil, with a focus on the impact of overpolicing and underpolicing on police legitimacy and attitudes towards personal use of violence. Sao Paulo is an extremely unequal city, where police brutality events are common in some neighborhoods but non-existent in others. Drawing on three waves of data from a representative survey of adult residents of eight neighborhoods, this study has three parts. First, results of a cross-lagged panel model demonstrate that perceptions of police intrusion and cynicism about police protection (a) are produced by neighborhood structural conditions and experiences of aggressive police stops, and (b) mutually reproduce each other. Second, results of hierarchical linear models show that perceptions of overpolicing and underpolicing undermine legitimacy judgements. Third, random-intercepts negative binomial models show that legitimacy judgements contribute to attitudes towards the acceptability of the use of violence, and a panel model demonstrates that legitimacy judgements longitudinally mediate the effect of perceived overpolicing and underpolicing on use of violence. This study provides further evidence on the costs of aggressive policing and the consequences of the overpolicing-underpolicing paradox, with implications to people’s recognition of the ruling power of the law and the legal institutions.

  <b>Abstract</b>: We study the spatial distribution of stops and searches in London in 2019, and assess the extent to which salient, spatially-granular economic inequality is associated with a higher concentration of searches net of previous crime rates and spatial effects. We interpret stop and search as a tool of social control and demonstrate the degree to which economic inequality contributes to filter out locations where members of the public might stopped and searched by police officers. We use data at the level of Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs) and draw on a novel measure of local inequality based on real and estimated housing values. Our analytic strategy involves estimating Spatial Durbin Models to account for spatial dependency and negative binomial regression models to estimate the number of stops and searches by LSOA. Results suggest that local economic inequality is strongly associated with the number of stops and searches, even taking into account spatial effects and previous crime rates. We also find that the effect of inequality depends on the level of affluence: the better off a location is, the stronger the effect of inequality on police stops and searches. We conclude by extending the cultural meaning of stop and search as a tool of social control. Police decisions regarding where to stop and search members of the public could be an additional mechanism that contributes to high levels of ethnic and social disproportionality in stop and search.

  <b>Abstract</b>: To what extent do police officers who are confident of their own authority support (or oppose) police militarization? Previous work has established possible links between police officers’ self-legitimacy and their commitment to democratic policing, which is based on principles of citizen participation, equity and responsiveness. Understood as the process through which policing activities take more and more characteristics of the military culture and behavior, police militarization premises on the idea that police officers should be trained as if they were going to war. Based on this nearly diametrical distinction and given the positive association found between self-legitimacy and commitment to democratic policing, we ask whether self-legitimacy is negatively associated with support for police militarization. Using data from a survey of officers from the São Paulo Military Police in 2016, we assess the extent to which measures of self-legitimacy are correlated with such support controlling for agents’ identification with military values – we also assess the extent to which self-legitimacy mediates the effects or other variables on support for police militarization, such as perceived public support and perceived distributive justice within the organization. Results of structural equation models indicate that while identification with military values mediate some statistical effects of perception of work environment on support for police militarization, self-belief in authority vested in them does not.
