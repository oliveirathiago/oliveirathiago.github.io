  <b>Objectives</b>: Test the asymmetry thesis of police-citizen contact that police trustworthiness and legitimacy are affected more by negative than by positive experiences of interactions with legal agents by analyzing changes in attitudes towards the police after an encounter with the police. Test whether prior attitudes moderate the impact of contact on changes in attitudes towards the police.<br>
  
  <b>Methods</b>: A two-wave panel survey of a nationally representative sample of Australian adults measured people’s beliefs about police trustworthiness (procedural fairness and effectiveness), their duty to obey the police, their contact with the police between the two waves, and their evaluation of those encounters in terms of process and outcome. Analysis is carried out using autoregressive structural equation modeling and latent moderated structural models.<br>
  
  <b>Results</b>: The association between both process and outcome evaluation of police-citizen encounters and changes in attitudes towards the police is asymmetrical for trust in police effectiveness, symmetrical for trust in procedural fairness, and asymmetrical (in the opposite direction expected) for duty to obey the police. Little evidence of heterogeneity in the association between encounters and trust in procedural fairness and duty to obey, but prior levels of perceived effectiveness moderate the association between outcome evaluation and changes in trust in police effectiveness.<br>
  
  <b>Conclusions</b>: The association between police-citizen encounters and attitudes towards the police may not be as asymmetrical as previously thought, particularly for changes in trust in procedural fairness and legitimacy. Policy implications include considering public-police interactions as ‘teachable moments’ and potential sources for enhancing police trustworthiness and legitimacy.

  <b>Abstract</b>.<br>
  <i>Objectives</i>: Test whethercooperation with the police can be modelledas aplace-based norm that varies in strength from one neighborhoodto the next. Estimatewhetherperceived police legitimacy predictsan  individual’s willingness  to  cooperate in weak-norm neighborhoods,but not in  strong-norm neighborhoodswhere most  people  are either willing or  unwilling to  cooperate, irrespective of  their perceptions of police legitimacy.<br>
  
  <i>Methods</i>: A survey of 1,057individuals in 98 relatively high-crime English neighborhoodsdefined at a small spatial scalemeasured(a) willingness to cooperate using a hypothetical crime vignetteand (b) legitimacy using indicators of normative alignmentbetween police and citizen values. A mixed-effects,location-scale  model  estimatedthe  cluster-level  mean  and cluster-level variance  of willingness  to cooperateas a neighborhood-level latent variable. A cross-level interaction testedwhether legitimacy predicts individual-level willingness to cooperateonly in neighborhoods where the norm is weak.<br>
  
  <i>Results</i>:Willingness to cooperate clusteredstrongly by neighborhood. Therewere neighborhoods with (i) high meanand low variance, (ii) high meanand high variance, (iii) (relatively) low meanand low variance, and (iv) (relatively) low meanand high variance. Legitimacy was only a positive predictor of cooperation  in neighborhoods  that had a (relatively) low  mean  and  high  variance.  There  was little variance left to explain in neighborhoods where the norm was strong.<br>
  
  <i>Conclusions</i>: Findingssupporta  boundary  condition  of  procedural  justice  theory:  namely, that cooperationcan  be  modelled  asa place-based norm  that  variesin  strengthfrom neighborhoodto neighborhoodand that legitimacy only predicts an  individual’s willingness  to  cooperate in neighborhoods wherethe norm is relatively weak.

### [1. Juvenile Sentencing: A Mixed-Methods Approach](http://oliveirathiago.github.io/files/paper_2019bpsr.pdf)

Published in *Brazilian Political Science Review*, 2019

<b>Abstract</b>: How do socially relevant attributes influence juvenile criminal sentencing? While judicial decisions should, in principle, be fully based on legally relevant factors such as the seriousness of the offense and the defendant’s criminal record, I ask whether and how extralegal characteristics related to the adolescent’s position in structural relations affect the decision-making process. I propose a mixed-methods design to study mechanisms of criminal sentencing. Using data from a representative sample of the São Paulo juvenile justice system records, I estimate mixed-effects logistic models to assess the probability of being sentenced to confinement given certain extralegal attributes, while controlling for legally relevant variables. Interaction effects show that adolescents registered as full-time students and classified as drug users are more likely to be sentenced to confinement than their counterparts, even when the arraignment is the same. The second step involved weekly visits to the juvenile courthouse in São Paulo over four months to observe judicial hearings. Prosecutors are central to the decision-making process. The standard decision-making mechanism is based on police documents and legally relevant information. When there is a rupture in the definition of the situation (usually when non-minority defendants enter the courtroom), a new mechanism emerges and more lenient decisions are made.
